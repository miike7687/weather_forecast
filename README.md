This was one of the most difficult/rewarding homework assignments I've done in this class. I KNOW there was a more concise way to create my page, but once I got rolling, I didn't want to stop. There were many times I could've created functions and loops to consolidate my code instead of manually coding each line, but I felt like it was a great learning experience for me. I also didn't do much research as far as trying to look at other people's codes. I created this app from my own knowledge and feel proud of it.

The one main thing I'm missing: -When all of the cities reload on the page, there is no way to click on each one to display all of the ajax information. I ran out of time for this step.

Things I'm proud of: -Manipulating Ajax calls with my own planning and psuedocoding. -Creating two click handlers (one for the current weather conditions and one for the five-day forecast) -I finished my work much earlier than most of my study group members so that I could explain all the processes to them. -I troubleshooted through every possible Local Storage option on how to store an array and then how to turn it into a string, split the string and display the split string onto an unordered list. -Figuring out how to create the icon and append it to the page. This took me a long time but I was proud to figure it out and explain it to my study group.

Things I need to work on: -Practice local storage -Psuedocode even better next time -CONSOLIDATE my code. <-- This is my biggest goal and I am very aware that this needs to be a major improvement next time.

Overall, I really enjoyed this challenging homework assignment and feel like I've learned so much!
